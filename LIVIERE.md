# Liviere/plane fork

A fork of Plane Community Edition with our own changes; it runs `plane.liviere.studio`.

## Branches

- `master`, `preview` – exact mirrors of [makeplane/plane](https://github.com/makeplane/plane). Never commit
  to them, only sync them with upstream.
- `liviere` – our changes on top of an official release (started from tag `v1.4.2`). New features go to
  `feat/*` branches and are merged into `liviere` via PR (note: in a fork GitHub suggests `makeplane/plane`
  as the PR target – change it).

## Releases and images

A `v<official version>-liviere.<n>` tag (e.g. `v1.4.2-liviere.1`) runs `.github/workflows/liviere-images.yml`,
which builds 6 images `ghcr.io/liviere/plane-{frontend,space,admin,live,backend,proxy}:<tag>`.
On the server: `PLANE_IMAGE_REPO=ghcr.io/liviere` and `APP_RELEASE=<tag>` in `plane.env`.

## Updating to a new official release

```sh
git fetch upstream --tags
git switch liviere && git merge v1.4.3   # an official tag, not preview
git tag v1.4.3-liviere.0 && git push origin liviere v1.4.3-liviere.0
```

Never merge `preview` – it carries database migrations that releases do not have yet.

## Rules for our changes

- **Database:** our own models live in a separate Django app (`apps/api/plane/liviere/`) with its own
  migrations. Do not add files to `apps/api/plane/db/migrations/` (numbering clashes with upstream). Instead of
  altering official tables, add separate tables linked 1:1 or by a foreign key.
- **Our code** goes to `liviere` directories next to the official code (`apps/api/plane/liviere/`,
  `apps/live/src/liviere/`, `apps/web/core/liviere/`); official files only get hook points (a few lines, marked
  `Liviere/plane fork`). Upstream removed the `apps/web/ce/` layer in v1.4 (#9245); its leftover stubs in
  `core/` (e.g. `core/store/pages/extended-base-page.ts`, `packages/types/src/page/extended.ts`) are the
  intended extension points.
- Our app `plane.liviere` (`apps.py`, registered in `INSTALLED_APPS`) holds our models, migrations
  (`plane/liviere/migrations/`), signals and Celery tasks (`plane/liviere/tasks.py`, found by autodiscovery).
  Periodic tasks are scheduled by `django_celery_beat` rows created in our migrations, not in `plane/celery.py`.
- Going back to the official images: our migrations only add tables, which the official code ignores, so a
  change of `PLANE_IMAGE_REPO`/`APP_RELEASE` still works; disable our periodic tasks first (see the feature
  sections). Removing our tables needs `manage.py migrate liviere zero` on a fork image.
- **Language:** code comments, documentation and commit messages are in English.

## Project pages API (`/api/v1/.../projects/{id}/pages/`)

Our code is in `apps/api/plane/liviere/` (`api/` public API, `app/` app endpoints, `live_client.py`),
`apps/live/src/liviere/` and `apps/web/core/liviere/`. Tests: `apps/api/plane/tests/contract/api/test_pages.py`,
`apps/live/tests/liviere/`; compatibility check against `plane-sdk==0.3.1`:
`apps/api/plane/liviere/scripts/sdk_pages_smoke.py`. The contract follows the SDK: list, retrieve, create,
`PUT`/`PATCH` (both partial), `POST`/`DELETE .../archive/`, `DELETE` (archived pages only).
Permissions are the same as in the UI (`ProjectPagePermission`).

**Content and title of a page opened in the editor.** The editor works on the Yjs document
(`description_binary`, fragments `default` and `title`) that the `live` server stores when a page is first
opened. Once it exists, the API never rebuilds it from HTML (an open editor would overwrite the change and a
browser's y-indexeddb copy would duplicate the content). Instead:

1. Django locks the page row and sends the stored binary and the change to `live`
   (`POST /live/liviere/page-edit/`, header `live-server-secret-key` = `LIVE_SERVER_SECRET_KEY`).
2. `live` computes the change against the stored document with `updateYFragment` (y-prosemirror): only the
   nodes that differ are changed, so unchanged paragraphs keep their Yjs items. If the page is open, the
   change is merged into the in-memory document as a CRDT update – editors see it immediately and text a person
   typed but `live` has not stored yet is kept. `live` returns the resulting binary, HTML and JSON.
3. Django stores binary, HTML, JSON and `name` in one write, then asks `live` to replay the update on a document
   opened in the meantime and on other `live` instances (`POST /live/liviere/page-edit/publish/`, Redis channel
   `hocuspocus:<page id>`).

If `live` cannot be reached, the API answers 503 and writes nothing. Pages without a binary (never opened) get
their HTML written directly; `live` builds the document from it on first open. `live` is found at
`settings.LIVE_URL`, else `LIVIERE_LIVE_URL`, else `http://live:3000/live/` (service name in the compose files).

The API replaces the whole content: text that is already stored but missing from the HTML sent by the client is
removed. Version history keeps the previous content (`track_page_version`; its v1.4.2 bug – it read the
non-existent `Page.description` and silently saved nothing – is fixed in this fork).

**Block API changes.** Page menu (•••) → *Block API changes*, available to the page owner and project admins
(`POST`/`DELETE /api/workspaces/.../pages/{id}/liviere/api-block/`, session only – API keys cannot reach it).
Stored as `view_props.liviere_block_api`; the app does not write page `view_props` (full width and sticky
toolbar are browser-local), but a project member sending a crafted app `PATCH` with `view_props` could
overwrite it. When on, every change through the API (update, archive, unarchive, delete) answers 409 and writes
nothing; reading works and returns `api_changes_blocked: true`.

**Locking.** `is_locked` can be set when creating a page through the API; locking and unlocking afterwards is
done in the app only (403 through the API). A locked page refuses every change through the API.

## Project activity (`/api/v1/.../projects/{id}/activity/`)

A per-project heatmap of when work happens, like GitHub contributions but finer: rows are days, columns are the
96 quarters of the day, the colour says how many actions happened in that quarter. It also gives an approximate
time (quarters with any activity × 15 min) – not logged working time.

Code: `apps/api/plane/liviere/activity/` (catalog, recording, queries), `liviere/models.py`
(`ActivityEvent`, `ProjectActivitySettings`), `liviere/app/activity.py` and `liviere/api/activity.py`
(endpoints), `apps/web/core/liviere/activity/` (page, settings, sidebar item), i18n namespace `liviere`
(`packages/i18n/src/locales/*/liviere.json`; only `en` and `pl` are translated). Tests:
`apps/api/plane/tests/contract/api/test_activity.py`.

**Recording.** Every action becomes an `ActivityEvent` (project, actor, time, kind, object):

- Work items: copied from `IssueActivity`, the history Plane keeps anyway, by the Celery task
  `plane.liviere.tasks.sync_issue_activity_events` every minute (django_celery_beat row
  `liviere: sync issue activity to activity events`). Each run takes rows updated since the last copy minus
  10 minutes and skips what it already has (`source_id` is unique), so it is idempotent and needs no change to
  the upstream activity task. Migration `0002` copies the whole existing history once.
- Pages, cycles, modules, views have no history table; Django signals record them (`activity/signals.py`).
  The actor comes from `crum` (the request user, also for API keys and for page content stored by `live`
  with the editor's cookie); saves without a user (background tasks) are skipped. Page content edits count at
  most once a minute per person and page (`live` stores an open page every ~10 s). Page archive/unarchive run
  raw SQL, so `PageViewSet.archive/unarchive` and our API call `record_page_archive` (hook in
  `plane/app/views/page/base.py`).

**Catalog** (`activity/kinds.py`; off by default: reactions/votes, views): work item created, state, property,
description, comment, link/attachment, relation/sub-item, cycle/module membership, archive/delete, intake;
page created, edited, renamed, archived/deleted; cycle changed, module changed; view changed; log entry.

**Settings** – Project settings → Features → Activity (project admins): *Enable Activity* (shows the item in
the project navigation; events are recorded either way) and the counted actions. Stored in
`ProjectActivitySettings`; the choice of actions applies at read time, so also to the past.

**API.** Project admins and members (not guests – events name work items a guest may not see):

| Endpoint | |
|---|---|
| `GET .../activity/heatmap/` | sparse buckets `[{date, slot (0-95), start, count, by_kind}]` + `summary` (`events`, `active_buckets`, `active_hours`, `by_kind`) |
| `GET .../activity/events/` | the actions, newest first, with actor and referenced work item/page/cycle/module/view (paginated like other v1 lists) |
| `GET .../activity/settings/` | `enabled`, counted `kinds`, `catalog` |

Parameters: `from`, `to` (local dates, default the last 30 days, at most 366), `tz` (IANA name, default the
project time zone), `actor` (user id), `kinds` (comma-separated, default the project setting); `events` also
takes `start`/`end` (ISO date-times, e.g. one quarter). On the day clocks go back, both copies of the repeated
hour fall into the same slots. The settings change only in the app
(`PATCH /api/workspaces/.../projects/{id}/liviere/activity/settings/`, project admin).

### Activity log (`/api/v1/.../projects/{id}/activity/logs/`)

What a person or an AI agent did and when, for work that leaves no other trace in Plane (code, servers,
research). An entry is an `ActivityEvent` with `source="log"`, `kind="log.entry"`, the text in `note`, the start
in `occurred_at` and an optional end in `ended_at`; it counts once in every quarter of its range and once in the
summary. Rules in `activity/logs.py`; migration `0003` adds the columns and `log.entry` to saved settings.

| Endpoint | |
|---|---|
| `GET .../activity/logs/` | entries (same parameters and format as `events/`, whatever kinds the project counts) |
| `POST .../activity/logs/` | new entry → 201 |
| `GET/PATCH/DELETE .../activity/logs/{id}/` | one entry |

Body: `text` (required, ≤ 4000 characters); time as `started_at` + `ended_at`, `started_at` +
`duration_minutes`, only `duration_minutes` (ends now) or only `started_at`/nothing (a moment, one quarter);
ISO date-times, without an offset in the project time zone; at most 12 h, not in the future. Optional `issue`
(UUID or identifier such as `ORD-12`) and `page` (UUID), both of this project. Admins and members write; the
author or a project admin changes and deletes (hard delete). A `PATCH` with a new start keeps the length. The
same endpoints exist for the app under `/api/workspaces/.../projects/{id}/liviere/activity/logs/`; the
*Activity* page has *Add entry* and edit/delete in the list of a quarter; its *Work log* tab (`?view=log`) lists
the entries of the chosen range by day, with the count and logged time per day, and loads more while scrolling.

**`liviere/tools/plane-log`** – a command-line client for agents (Python standard library only). It reads the
token from `~/.config/plane-mcp/env`, like the Plane MCP setup, and takes project identifiers:
`plane-log add -p ORD --minutes 40 --issue ORD-12 "…"`, `plane-log list -p ORD --date … [--at HH:MM --events]`,
`plane-log edit`/`rm`. The `plane-mcp-server` package does not know these endpoints.

**Disabling the sync** (e.g. before going back to images without our code, where the worker would log an unknown
task): `docker compose exec api python manage.py shell -c "from django_celery_beat.models import PeriodicTask;
PeriodicTask.objects.filter(name__startswith='liviere:').update(enabled=False)"`.
